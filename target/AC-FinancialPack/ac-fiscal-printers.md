# Fiscal printers

The **Fiscal Printers - VAROS** module is used to create and print a cash receipt on a VAROS fiscal printer.

When you post primary documents (invoice, order, credit note) with a payment breakdown (one or more types of remittances), fiscal entries are automatically created and sent to the fiscal printer for printing. Printing on the fiscal printer also occurs when the payment breakdown is posted on the created or posted document (invoice, credit note, prepayment).

Also, all cash deposits and withdrawals to the cash register are recorded and printed on the fiscal printer.
