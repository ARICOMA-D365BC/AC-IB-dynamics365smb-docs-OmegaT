# Insolvency register

The **Insolvency Register** add-on is used to record records downloaded from the https://isir.justice.cz on the insolvency proceedings of companies.

It is a tool for further actions with the company's contacts that are in insolvency proceedings, e.g. when entering sales documents, their accounting (delivery, invoicing). It provides selected persons of the company with up-to-date information on new entries in the insolvency register.
