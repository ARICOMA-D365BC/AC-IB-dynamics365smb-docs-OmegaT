# Task publishing

The **Publishing Tasks** add-on module is an extension module for Sharepoint Publishing. Extends publishing capabilities at two levels:
- basic publishing of tasks and their parameters
- Publish tasks based on advanced settings through publishing templates (requires the Publishing Templates module).

It allows you to publish tasks to SharePoint directly from the Dynamics 365 Business Central environment, link them to records in information system tables, and supplement them with user-defined parameters (metadata).
