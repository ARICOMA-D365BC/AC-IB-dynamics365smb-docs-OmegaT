# SharePoint publishing

The **SharePoint Publishing** add-on module allows you to publish documents in the SharePoint central data store, file system or Dynamics 365 Business Central database directly from the Dynamics 365 Business Central environment and link them to the records in the information system tables. Attached published documents can be opened directly from Dynamics 365 Business Central in an associated application. The module thus significantly expands the information value and the possibility of using records in dynamics 365 Business Central. A practical use of this technology is to connect product information to goods cards or business documents (e.g. contracts) to supplier or customer cards.
