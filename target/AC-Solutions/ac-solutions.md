# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

It offers increased productivity and competitiveness, saves upfront investment and reduces operational and safety concerns.

Data is available anytime and from anywhere. Operation of the information system is possible in the cloud or in your own environment. Online system operation in the cloud has a major advantage in lower initial implementation costs, ensured security, and easier system updates. Users can connect from a computer, smartphone or tablet with Google Android or Apple iOS.
